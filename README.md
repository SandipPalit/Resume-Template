## Setup the Code locally

To transform this Resume Template, to your wonderful online Resume, we will follow some simple steps. Starting with getting a copy of the codebase, in our local machine.

To setup the code locally in our machine, we will follow these steps:
1. Fork this [Resume Template repository](https://github.com/SandipPalit/Resume-Template). ![Fork](/documentation/fork.jpg)
2. Download the Codebase on your Local machine.
3. Open the Codebase in PyCharm or any IDE of your choice.
4. Open Terminal and Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, to install the necessary libraries.

> It will take some time, after which our setup will be completed.

## Customize the Resume

Now here comes the most interesting part, to customize this Resume Template we only need to change the content of some JSON files. Yes, you read it right!! We don't have to change any piece of code.

We can use Markdown text formatting in our text descriptions, like `**Bold**` for **Bold**, `_Italic_` for _Italic_, and `[Link](https://www.google.com)` for [Link](https://www.google.com).

Before customizing our code, we will start our streamlit app by running `streamlit run app.py` in the Terminal. The app will start on our default browser, and we will get the exact same UI as seen on [the Template](https://resume-template.streamlit.app/).

Now, all we need to do is, modify the files in the **assets** folder, which has the following file structure.
